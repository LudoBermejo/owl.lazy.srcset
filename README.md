# Owl lazy srcset plugins

A modification of lazy src plugin to support srcset images 

Usage
=====

Load the plugin AFTER load the owl-carousel. It will replace the old one.

Then, you can use data-srcset as usual; it will add this attr to the img objects (only img for now) when the dummy image is loaded.
